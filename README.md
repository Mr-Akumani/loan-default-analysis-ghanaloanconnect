## 📋 Project Overview

This data analytics project addresses the critical challenge of loan defaults in Ghana's non-bank financial institution (NBFI) sector. GhanaLoanConnect, a peer-to-peer lending platform, faces a 16.01% default rate—significantly above industry standards—threatening its sustainability and financial inclusion mission.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

1. **Identify High-Risk Segments**: Pinpoint sectors and borrower profiles with the highest default probability
2. **Diagnose Root Causes**: Analyze factors driving repayment difficulties  
3. **Develop Mitigation Strategies**: Recommend data-driven interventions to reduce defaults by 20%

## 💡 Key Insights & Impact
Analysis of 9,578 loan records revealed critical risk patterns:

*   **Small Business loans** showed the highest vulnerability with a **28% default rate**, followed by Educational loans at **20%**
*   **Credit scores** demonstrated strong predictive power - borrowers with FICO 600-649 had a **32% default rate** vs **7%** for 750+
*   **Interest rate correlation** was evident - loans >15% interest had **24.8% default rate** vs **4.2%** for rates <8%
*   **Machine learning model** achieved **84% accuracy** in predicting high-risk borrowers

## 🚀 Recommendations & Implementation
A phased strategy was developed to transform risk management:

1.  **Risk-Based Pricing:** Implement tiered interest rates (8%-18%) based on borrower risk profiles
2.  **Sector-Specific Underwriting:** Apply enhanced due diligence for Small Business and Educational loans
3.  **Automated Decision Systems:** Integrate ML model to flag high-risk applicants and reduce processing time by 65%
4.  **Portfolio Diversification:** Rebalance toward lower-risk segments (Major Purchases: 11% default, Credit Cards: 12%)

## 📈 Expected Business Impact
- **Default Reduction:** From 16.01% to ~13% (20% improvement)
- **Financial Savings:** GHC 6.3 million annually with 225% ROI
- **Payback Period:** 3.7 months
- **Operational Efficiency:** 65% faster loan processing
